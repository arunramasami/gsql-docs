== Example

These functions can be used as part of expression in the `WHERE` clause.
For example, the following statement only loads a record if the `score` column of a record is greater than 95.5:

[,gsql]
----
LOAD f TO VERTEX Person
  VALUES ($"name", $"score")
  WHERE to_float($"score") > 95.5
----
